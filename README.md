I find the concept behind Conway's Game of Life one of the most interesting in all of Computer Science. The theory that the world has emerged from a simple set of rules and formed complex structures that have unpredictable behaivour is elegant in it's own way. 

The rules are as follows:
    1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
    2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
